# sunOS, be free!
## sunOS is a web operating system which is made for locked down school/work devices if you want to just have some fun, especially during breaks. With the App Explorer, you can browse applications which are either ports of existing apps or completely new apps made by the community.

# Who's working on this stuff?
## I do all the hard work, the community either suggests stuff or contributors code stuff in.

# This looks suspiciously like Envy (envywebos.github.io)
## Well, let me tell you about Envy. I used to work on Envy which is a project by nintendowiigi or OwnedByWuigi on GitHub (I'll call him wuigi). Wuigi then decided that Envy was useless and deleted it. This is a fork of Envy where I downloaded it before the repo got deleted. Wuigi wants Envy truly gone and as a result, any Envy backup repository will be gone (I think).
